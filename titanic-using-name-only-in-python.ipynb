So, I implemented his notebook ('Titanic using Name only') in Python 3. \n","Chris Deotte uses only one column i.e. 'Name' to predict survival. He also used the 'Ticket' column to improve his predictions by a margin. I have, however, solely relied on the 'Name' column to make predictions with an accuracy of ~0.8.\n","\n","What I like about Chris' approach is his model's simplicity. Many kernels have used complex Machine Learning models to give comparatively poor predictions. Chris does not use Machine Learning at all. He uses some common sense to make relatively accurate guesses. I hope you find this notebook helpful."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"1d87ba40","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-22T19:09:06.30513Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-22T19:09:06.304771Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-22T19:09:06.315049Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-22T19:09:06.314201Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.063924,"end_time":"2022-04-22T19:09:06.317569","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-22T19:09:06.253645","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import
